# Minimal Connected Automaton Generator

Welcome to the Minimal Connected Automaton Generator. This project was developed for the Theoretical Computer Science course and is designed to generate minimal connected automata for both Moore and Mealy machines.

The tool provides an intuitive graphical interface for users to build their machines using the state transition table representation. The project is implemented in React, providing a fast and user-friendly experience.

To get started, follow the standard commands to run the application. Additionally, we have included detailed JSDoc documentation of the logical part of the solution, so you can easily understand and modify the code to fit your requirements.

You will find a user manual in PDF format in the "docs" folder of the project. It contains further information on how to use the application.
